# Message Generator

This program generates randomized messages. Each time you run it, you'll get a unique output.

1.  **Randomized Output:** The program guarantees a new, randomized message with each execution.

2.  **Example Output:**  The generated messages combine different parts to create interesting outputs like "His bike needs to be washed."  I aimed for a more varied and sometimes nonsensical output to make it fun.  (e.g., "Your balance got to be kidding me.")

3.  **Data Composition:**  To ensure randomness, each message is constructed from at least three different pieces of data. I structured these data pieces into arrays nested within an object for better organization. I used four sets of data:
     - Personal pronouns (example: You, He, She)
     -  Possessive pronouns (example: Your, His, Her)
     - Objects (example: bike, balance)
     - Predicates (example: will get that, got to be kidding me)

4.  **Code Comments:** The code is thoroughly commented to explain the logic and my thought process.

5.  **Git and GitHub:** I'm using Git for version control and have pushed this project to GitHub to demonstrate my progress and improve my Git skills. You can find the repository code in [here](https://github.com/LeonardBoecker/message-generator).
