    ## Message genarator

    1. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 
    2. I chose make it different and make some random to out put like === "his bottle of water runs fast".
    To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up 
    of at least **three different pieces of data**, in which I chose four but inside
    an object with some array.
    3. So run it and make it fun.
    4. The code is commented to better understand of my thoughts
